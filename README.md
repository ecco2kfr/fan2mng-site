# Soeur - Website Style Showcase

This project is a website designed to showcase a particular visual and interactive style. It features a unique, experimental, and somewhat cryptic aesthetic with dynamic text elements and distinct sections.

## Project Purpose

The primary purpose of this project is to present the website's design and user experience. While it previously hosted playable sound files, these are no longer available. The focus is now entirely on demonstrating the site's unique visual presentation and interactive elements.

## Features

* **Experimental Design:** A distinctive and unconventional layout.
* **Dynamic Text:** Scrolling and altering text elements for an engaging visual effect.
* **Structured Content:** Organized sections, each with a unique visual identity.
* **Navigation:** Simple navigation to different sections of the site (though external links for sounds are present, they are non-functional for audio playback).

## Note on Sounds

Please note that the audio files linked throughout the website are no longer hosted or available for playback. This project is maintained solely to showcase the website's unique design and style.
